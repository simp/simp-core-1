This directory has been set up as an example of how you can configure your
kickstart directory.

It should suffice for most clients built from the default load, but you may
extend this kickstart space as fits your needs.

It is suggested that you always start with the pupclient*.cfg files and only add
additional diskdetect scripts to meet your space needs.  If you extend the
kickstart files, particularly the package lists, then future management of the
systems may become overly complicated.

Remember, the premise of this system is that you start small and secure and you
extend via Puppet to create your desired environment.
