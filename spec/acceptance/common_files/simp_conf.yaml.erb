# You can use these answers to quickly configure subsequent
# simp installations by running the command:
#
#   simp config -A /PATH/TO/THIS/FILE
#
# simp config will prompt for any missing items.
#
# NOTE:
# - All YAML keys that begin with 'cli::' are used by
#   simp config, internally, and are not Puppet hieradata.
# - Some entries have been automatically determined by
#   `simp config` based on the values of other entries
#   and/or gathered server status.

# === cli::version ===
# The version of simp-cli used to generate this file.

# === chrony::servers ===
# NTP time servers used by cronyd
chrony::servers: "%{alias('simp_options::ntp::servers')}"

# === cli::ensure_priv_local_user ===
# Whether to configure a privileged local user to prevent server lockout
# after bootstrap.
#
# SIMP by default disables remote logins for all users and disables `root`
# logins at the console. So, after bootstrap, you are very likely to lose
# access to this system, **unless** you configure a local user to have
# `sudo` and `ssh` access.
#
# Enter 'yes' if want to configure a local user to have `sudo` and `ssh`
# access after bootstrap.
#
# * You will select the local user to configure.
# * The local user will be created for you if it does not already exist.
# * If the user already exists and has ssh authorized keys, those keys
#   will be copied to /etc/ssh/local_keys/, the default directory for
#   local user SSH authorized keys files in SIMP.
cli::ensure_priv_local_user: false

# === cli::is_simp_ldap_server ===
# Whether the SIMP server will also be a SIMP-provided LDAP server.
#
# Enter 'yes' if want to use SIMP-provided LDAP and have the SIMP
# server also be the LDAP server.
#
# Enter 'no' if you do not want to use LDAP, you want to use some other
# LDAP implementation, or you want to set up SIMP-provided LDAP in a
# different configuration.  In these cases, you will need to set up
# appropriate central authentication services manually before or
# after bootstrapping.
cli::is_simp_ldap_server: true

# === cli::network::gateway ===

# TODO Remove this when SIMP-6625 is completed.  This value is not actually
# required by simp config when cli::set_up_nic is false.
cli::network::gateway: 1.2.3.4

# === cli::network::hostname ===

# === cli::network::set_up_nic ===
# Whether to configure and activate this NIC now. A properly configured
# NIC with associated hostname is required for SIMP to be bootstrapped.
#
# If you enter 'yes', this will immediately, with appropriate prompts for
# networking information, do the following:
# - Configure the NIC for static or DHCP operation
# - Set the hostname associated with the NIC
# - **RESET** the interface to ensure proper activation of the NIC.
#
# If you enter 'no', this will prompt you to enter all the NIC's networking
# information, including the hostname, and `simp config` will **ASSUME** the
# network has been configured and activated.
#
# You should enter 'yes' if the interface has not yet been configured.
# You may want to enter 'yes', if you want to reconfigure it and are **NOT**
# logged into the server via this interface.

# 'simp_lite' = Settings for a SIMP system in which some security features
#               are disabled for SIMP clients.  The SIMP server will

# 'poss'      = Settings for a SIMP system in which all security features
#               for the SIMP clients are disabled.  The SIMP server will
#               be running with all security features enabled.
#
# NOTE:  If your site has different needs than provided by the predetermined
# scenarios, you can always fine-tune the security settings after you have
# bootstrapped your SIMP server.
cli::simp::scenario: <%= scenario %>

# === cli::use_internet_simp_yum_repos ===
# Whether to configure SIMP nodes to use internet SIMP and
# SIMP dependency YUM repositories.

# SIMP repositories.

#
# If the first entry of this list is set to '127.0.0.1', then

#
# If you are using the SIMP ``resolv`` module, and the system is a DNS server
# using the SIMP ``named`` module but you wish to have your node point to a
# different DNS server for primary DNS resolution, then you MUST set
# ``resolv::named_server`` to ``true`` via Hiera.
#
# This will get around the convenience logic that was put in place to handle
# the caching entries and will not attempt to convert your system to a
# caching DNS server.
simp_options::dns::servers: [ <%= nameserver %> ]

# === simp_options::ldap ===
# Whether to use SIMP LDAP support on this system.

#
# A consistent time source is critical to a functioning public key
# infrastructure, and thus your site security. **DO NOT** attempt to
# run multiple production systems using individual hardware clocks!
#
# For many networks, the default gateway (10.0.2.2) provides an NTP server.

# === sssd::domains ===
# A list of domains for SSSD to use.
#
# * When you are using SIMP-provided LDAP, this field should include `LDAP`,

# * This field may include 'LOCAL', to use the domain SIMP creates with

#               to the system
#
# NOTICE: svckill is the mechanism that SIMP uses to comply with the
# requirement that no unauthorized services are running on your system.
# If you are fully aware of all services that need to be running on the
# system, including any custom applications, use 'enforcing'.  If you
# first need to ascertain which services should be running on the system,
# use 'warning'.
svckill::mode: warning

# === useradd::securetty ===
# A list of TTYs for which the root user can login.
#
# When useradd::securetty is an empty list, the system will satisfy FISMA
# regulations, which require root login via any TTY (including the console)
# to be disabled.  For some systems, the inability to login as root via the
# console is problematic.  In that case, you may wish to include at least
# tty0 to the list of allowed TTYs, despite the security risk.
#
useradd::securetty:
- tty0
- tty1
- tty2
- tty3
