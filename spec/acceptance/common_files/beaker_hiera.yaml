# Settings for test access
# * vagrant ssh access to nodes using the public key in /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
#   - This allows you to `vagrant ssh` into the node
#
# * root ssh access to nodes using the public key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
#   - This allows beaker to access nodes during test steps (e.g., on(host,...)
